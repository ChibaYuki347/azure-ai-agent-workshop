# Overview

This report compiles supplementary content for the Azure AI Agent Workshop.

## Workshop Structure

The workshop structure is documented in ‘docs/ja/workshop-structure.md’.

All content included in this repository exists to support the structure of this workshop.

If you determine that altering the structure itself would be beneficial while creating code, do not modify the workshop structure arbitrarily. Always ask users what changes should be made.

Prioritize English users first, followed by Japanese users. Use English as the base language, including the README, while also supporting Japanese through formats like README.ja.md.
